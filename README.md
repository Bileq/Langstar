This is an Expo project created with create-expo-app.

Just a simple mobile app for my own usage. It will rate me using star system based on my time spend on learning my goal language

It will give me stars based on amount of hours I have spent learning.

Star system: 

15 - pass
30 - max

30 - SS
28 - S
25 - A 
20 - B
15 - PASS
>15 - F

One star = One hour
Reset once per week

I want also to implement daily, weekly and montly stats and something for exceeding star limit.
